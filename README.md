# Text-Extraction-From-Video-Using-Tesseract-OCR

This project uses Tesseract-OCR to recognize the text from the frames in the video and then creates a .docx file and writes all the recognized text from the video in the form of notes.

Currently working on adding this as a chrome extension which can be used to take notes while watching YouTube videos or while in a class video meeting in Google Meet, MS Teams.

This Project is Contributed by "**R N SNEHA PRIYA**".
